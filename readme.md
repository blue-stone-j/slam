# introduction

Some popular slam frames. I add comments to these code. If there is error like "`lego_loam/cloud_info.h` can't found", just try to compile for several times.

### environment requirements

Environment requirements are list on my [homepage](https://github.com/blue-stone-j). All code can compile and run in this environment.
